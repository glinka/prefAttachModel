\title{\vspace{-5mm}Differences between canonical preferential attachment model and Bal\'{a}zs'}
\maketitle

The canonical preferential attachment model, described in the attached paper and called the ``Bar\'{a}basi-Albert model'', describes a method of \textbf{constructing} a network that will have a power-law degree distribution. The method is simple:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Begin with a complete graph on $m_0$ vertices
\item Add an additional $m$ vertices which will be connected to $k \leq m_0$ of the existing vertices with probability $P_i = \frac{d_i}{\sum\limits_j d_j}$ where $d_i$ is the degree of $v_i$
\end{enumerate}

Bal\'{a}zs' model, fully called the ``edge-conservative preferential attachment model'' describes, of course, a method of \textbf{evolving} a network. At each step, the probability that an edge is added to vertex $i$ is given by $P_i = \frac{d_i + \kappa}{\sum\limits_i d_i + n \kappa}$. \\ \\ \\

{\huge Thus when they hear ``preferential attachment'', people may think of a network \textbf{construction} algorithm, and may be familiar with $P_i = \frac{d_i}{\sum\limits_j d_j}$ instead of $P_i = \frac{d_i + \kappa}{\sum\limits_j d_j + n \kappa}$.}
