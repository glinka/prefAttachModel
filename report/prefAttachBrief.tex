\section*{Introduction}
The preferential attachment model, detailed in \cite{balasz:rsa12}, was implemented in C++. The system naturally converges to a limiting ``graphon'' (see \cite{lovasz:jcombth06}), and, in order to increase the rate of convergence, coarse projective integration was implemented. This brief outlines the model dynamics and reviews current simulation progress.
\section*{Preferential Attachment Model}
This vertex- and edge-conservative model begins with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph in which $m$ edges are randomly assigned to $n$ vertices.
