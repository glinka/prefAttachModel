We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efficient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.},

As an important way to measure the similarity between pairwise graphs error-tolerantly, graph edit distance (GED) is the base of inexact graph matching. The research advance of GED is surveyed in order to provide a review of the existing literatures and offer some insights into the studies of GED. Since graphs may be attributed or non-attributed and the definition of costs for edit operations is various, the existing GED algorithms are categorized according to these two factors and described in detail. After these algorithms are analyzed and their limitations are identified, several promising directions for further research are proposed.},

We investigate how the limit object evolves under the edge reconnecting dynamics if we rescale time properly: we give the complete characterization of the time evolution of the limit object from its initial state up to the stationary state, which is described in the companion paper arXiv:1106.2058. In our proofs we use the theory of exchangeable arrays, queuing and diffusion processes.

	abstract = {A global economy and increase in customer expectations in terms of cost and services have put a premium on effective supply chain reengineering. It is essential to perform risk-benefit analysis of reengineering alternatives before making a final decision. Simulation provides an effective pragmatic approach to detailed analysis and evaluation of supply chain design and management alternatives. However, the utility of this methodology is hampered by the time and effort required to develop models with sufficient fidelity to the actual supply chain of interest. In this paper, we describe a supply chain modeling framework designed to overcome this difficulty. Using our approach, supply chain models are composed from software components that represent types of supply chain agents (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, transporters), their constituent control elements (e.g., inventory policy), and their interaction protocols (e.g., message types). The underlying library of supply chain modeling components has been derived from analysis of several different supply chains. It provides a reusable base of domain-specific primitives that enables rapid development of customized decision support tools.},

Understanding transmission of these viruses necessitates taking into account their evolution, which represents a challenge for developing mathematical models. This is because the phrasing of multi-strain systems in terms of traditional compartmental ODE models either requires simplifying assumptions to be made that overlook important evolutionary processes, or leads to complex dynamical systems that are too cumbersome to analyse.
RESULTS: Here, we develop an Individual-Based Model (IBM) in order to address simultaneously the ecology, epidemiology and evolution of strain-polymorphic pathogens, using Influenza A viruses as an illustrative example.
CONCLUSIONS: We carry out careful validation of our IBM against comparable mathematical models to demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm and the sound basis for this novel framework. We discuss how this new approach can give critical insights in the study of influenza evolution.},

	abstract = {We consider a simplified model of a social network in which individuals have one of two opinions (called 0 and 1) and their opinions and the network connections coevolve. Edges are picked at random. If the two connected individuals hold different opinions then, with probability 1 - Œ±, one imitates the opinion of the other; otherwise (i.e., with probability Œ±), the link between them is broken and one of them makes a new connection to an individual chosen at random (i) from those with the same opinion or (ii) from the network as a whole. The evolution of the system stops when there are no longer any discordant edges connecting individuals with different opinions. Letting œÅ be the fraction of voters holding the minority opinion after the evolution stops, we are interested in how œÅ depends on Œ± and the initial fraction u of voters with opinion 1. In case (i), there is a critical value Œ±c which does not depend on u, with œÅ ‚âà u for Œ± {\textgreater} Œ±c and œÅ ‚âà 0 for Œ± {\textless} Œ±c. In case (ii), the transition point Œ±c(u) depends on the initial density u. For Œ± {\textgreater} Œ±c(u), œÅ ‚âà u, but for Œ± {\textless} Œ±c(u), we have œÅ(Œ±,u) = œÅ(Œ±,1/2).

	abstract = {The performance of information processing systems, from artificial neural networks to natural neuronal ensembles, depends heavily on the underlying system architecture. In this study, we compare the performance of parallel and layered network architectures during sequential tasks that require both acquisition and retention of information, thereby identifying tradeoffs between learning and memory processes. During the task of supervised, sequential function approximation, networks produce and adapt representations of external information. Performance is evaluated by statistically analyzing the error in these representations while varying the initial network state, the structure of the external information, and the time given to learn the information. We link performance to complexity in network architecture by characterizing local error landscape curvature. We find that variations in error landscape structure give rise to tradeoffs in performance; these include the ability of the network to maximize accuracy versus minimize inaccuracy and produce specific versus generalizable representations of information. Parallel networks generate smooth error landscapes with deep, narrow minima, enabling them to find highly specific representations given sufficient time. While accurate, however, these representations are difficult to generalize. In contrast, layered networks generate rough error landscapes with a variety of local minima, allowing them to quickly find coarse representations. Although less accurate, these representations are easily adaptable. The presence of measurable performance tradeoffs in both layered and parallel networks has implications for understanding the behavior of a wide variety of natural and artificial learning systems.},

The simulated activities were compared with the actual observed activities of 5,196 vehicles that were inferred from Global Positioning System logs covering approximately 6 months. The results show that the reconstructed activity chains are both spatially and temporally accurate, especially in areas of high activity density.

Being able to find the intrinsic low-dimensionality in ensembles of graphs can be useful in a variety of modeling contexts, especially when coarse-graining the detailed graph information is of interest. One of the main challenges in mining graph data is the definition of a suitable pairwise similarity metric in the space of graphs. We explore two practical solutions to solving this problem: one based on finding subgraph densities, and one using spectral information. The approach is illustrated on three test data sets (ensembles of graphs); two of these are obtained from standard graph generating algorithms, while the graphs in the third example are sampled as dynamic snapshots from an evolving network simulation.},

In the analysis of large scale simulations of complex dynamical systems, where the notion of time evolution comes into play, important problems are the identification of slow variables and dynamically meaningful reaction coordinates that capture the long time evolution of the system. In this paper we provide a unifying view of these apparently different tasks, by considering a family of diffusion maps, defined as the embedding of complex (high dimensional) data onto a low dimensional Euclidean space, via the eigenvectors of suitably defined random walks defined on the given datasets. Assuming that the data is randomly sampled from an underlying general probability distribution p ( x ) = e ‚àí U ( x ) , we show that as the number of samples goes to infinity, the eigenvectors of each diffusion map converge to the eigenfunctions of a corresponding differential operator defined on the support of the probability distribution. Different normalizations of the Markov chain on the graph lead to different limiting differential operators. Specifically, the normalized graph Laplacian leads to a backward Fokker‚ÄìPlanck operator with an underlying potential of 2 U ( x ) , best suited for spectral clustering. A different anisotropic normalization of the random walk leads to the backward Fokker‚ÄìPlanck operator with the potential U ( x ) , best suited for the analysis of the long time asymptotics of high dimensional stochastic systems governed by a stochastic differential equation with the same potential U ( x ) . Finally, yet another normalization leads to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami (heat) operator on the manifold in which the data resides, best suited for the analysis of the geometry of the dataset regardless of its possibly non-uniform density.},
