	abstract = {In recent years, evaluating graph distance has become more and more important in a variety of real applications and many graph distance measures have been proposed. Among all of those measures, structure-based graph distance measures have become the research focus due to their independence of the definition of cost functions. However, existing structure-based graph distance measures have low degree of precision because only node and edge information of graphs are employed in these measures. To improve the precision of graph distance measures, we define substructure abundance vector (SAV) to capture more substructure information of a graph. Furthermore, based on SAV, we propose unified graph distance measures which are generalization of the existing structure-based graph distance measures. In general, the unified graph distance measures can evaluate graph distance in much finer grain. We also show that unified graph distance measures based on occurrence mapping and some of their variants are metrics. Finally, we apply the unified graph distance metric and its variants to the population evolution analysis and construct distance graphs of marker networks in three populations, which reflect the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage disequilibrium (LD) differences among these populations.},

	abstract = {We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases
of which include the random walk (Gärtner et al., 2003; Borgwardt et al., 2005)
and marginalized (Kashima et al., 2003, 2004; Mahét al., 2004) 
graph kernels. Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the
time complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with 
n vertices from O(n6) to O(n3). We find a spectral
decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel
matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point
methods that take O(dn3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the
label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge
kernels, and O(n4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs
these algorithms only take O(n2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments
on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that
these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of
magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels
(Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs
reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our
framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a
kernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of
kernel of Fröhlich et al. (2006) yet provably positive semi-definite.},

Detailed individual-based mathematical models on complex networks play an important role towards this aim. In this work, it is shown how one can exploit the Equation-Free approach and optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing to bridge detailed individual-based epidemic models with coarse-grained, system-level analysis within a pair-wise representation perspective. The proposed computational methodology provides a systematic approach for analyzing the parametric behavior of complex/multiscale epidemic simulators much more efficiently than simply simulating forward in time. It is shown how steady state and (if required) time-dependent computations, stability computations, as well as continuation and numerical bifurcation analysis can be performed in a straightforward manner. The approach is illustrated through a simple individual-based SIRS epidemic model deploying on a random regular connected graph. Using the individual-based simulator as a black box coarse-grained timestepper and with the aid of Simulated Annealing I compute the coarse-grained equilibrium bifurcation diagram and analyze the stability of the stationary states sidestepping the necessity of obtaining explicit closures at the macroscopic level.},

Graph edit distance is one of the most widely accepted measures to determine similarities between graphs and has extensive applications in the fields of pattern recognition, computer vision etc. Unfortunately, the problem of graph edit distance computation is NP-Hard in general. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce three novel methods to compute the upper and lower bounds for the edit distance between two graphs in polynomial time. Applying these methods, two algorithms AppFull and AppSub are introduced to perform different kinds of graph search on graph databases. Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to examine various aspects of the methods for bounding graph edit distance. Result shows that these methods achieve good scalability in terms of both the number of graphs and the size of graphs. The effectiveness of these algorithms also confirms the usefulness of using our bounds in filtering and searching of graphs.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of graph based object representation has gained popularity. Simultaneously, graph edit distance emerged as a powerful and flexible graph matching paradigm that can be used to address different tasks in pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. The key advantages of graph edit distance are its high degree of flexibility, which makes it applicable to any type of graph, and the fact that one can integrate domain specific knowledge about object similarity by means of specific edit cost functions. Its computational complexity, however, is exponential in the number of nodes of the involved graphs. Consequently, exact graph edit distance is feasible for graphs of rather small size only. In the present paper we introduce a novel algorithm which allows us to approximately, or suboptimally, compute edit distance in a substantially faster way. The proposed algorithm considers only local, rather than global, edge structure during the optimization process. In experiments on different datasets we demonstrate a substantial speed-up of our proposed method over two reference systems. Moreover, it is emprically verified that the accuracy of the suboptimal distance remains sufficiently accurate for various pattern recognition applications.},

	abstract = {A central problem in data analysis is the low dimensional representation of high dimensional data and the concise description of its underlying geometry and density. In the analysis of large scale simulations of complex dynamical systems, where the notion of time evolution comes into play, important problems are the identification of slow variables and dynamically meaningful reaction coordinates that capture the long time evolution of the system. In this paper we provide a unifying view of these apparently different tasks, by considering a family of diffusion maps, defined as the embedding of complex (high dimensional) data onto a low dimensional Euclidean space, via the eigenvectors of suitably defined random walks defined on the given datasets. Assuming that the data is randomly sampled from an underlying general probability distribution p ( x ) = e − U ( x ) , we show that as the number of samples goes to infinity, the eigenvectors of each diffusion map converge to the eigenfunctions of a corresponding differential operator defined on the support of the probability distribution. Different normalizations of the Markov chain on the graph lead to different limiting differential operators. Specifically, the normalized graph Laplacian leads to a backward Fokker–Planck operator with an underlying potential of 2 U ( x ) , best suited for spectral clustering. A different anisotropic normalization of the random walk leads to the backward Fokker–Planck operator with the potential U ( x ) , best suited for the analysis of the long time asymptotics of high dimensional stochastic systems governed by a stochastic differential equation with the same potential U ( x ) . Finally, yet another normalization leads to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami (heat) operator on the manifold in which the data resides, best suited for the analysis of the geometry of the dataset regardless of its possibly non-uniform density.},

It is essential to perform risk-benefit analysis of reengineering alternatives before making a final decision. Simulation provides an effective pragmatic approach to detailed analysis and evaluation of supply chain design and management alternatives. However, the utility of this methodology is hampered by the time and effort required to develop models with sufficient fidelity to the actual supply chain of interest. In this paper, we describe a supply chain modeling framework designed to overcome this difficulty. Using our approach, supply chain models are composed from software components that represent types of supply chain agents (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, transporters), their constituent control elements (e.g., inventory policy), and their interaction protocols (e.g., message types). The underlying library of supply chain modeling components has been derived from analysis of several different supply chains. It provides a reusable base of domain-specific primitives that enables rapid development of customized decision support tools.},

RESULTS: Here, we develop an Individual-Based Model (IBM) in order to address simultaneously the ecology, epidemiology and evolution of strain-polymorphic pathogens, using Influenza A viruses as an illustrative example.
CONCLUSIONS: We carry out careful validation of our IBM against comparable mathematical models to demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm and the sound basis for this novel framework. We discuss how this new approach can give critical insights in the study of influenza evolution.},

The evolution of the system stops when there are no longer any discordant edges connecting individuals with different opinions. Letting ρ be the fraction of voters holding the minority opinion after the evolution stops, we are interested in how ρ depends on α and the initial fraction u of voters with opinion 1. In case (i), there is a critical value αc which does not depend on u, with ρ ≈ u for α {\textgreater} αc and ρ ≈ 0 for α {\textless} αc. In case (ii), the transition point αc(u) depends on the initial density u. For α {\textgreater} αc(u), ρ ≈ u, but for α {\textless} αc(u), we have ρ(α,u) = ρ(α,1/2).

	abstract = {The performance of information processing systems, from artificial neural networks to natural neuronal ensembles, depends heavily on the underlying system architecture. In this study, we compare the performance of parallel and layered network architectures during sequential tasks that require both acquisition and retention of information, thereby identifying tradeoffs between learning and memory processes. During the task of supervised, sequential function approximation, networks produce and adapt representations of external information. Performance is evaluated by statistically analyzing the error in these representations while varying the initial network state, the structure of the external information, and the time given to learn the information. We link performance to complexity in network architecture by characterizing local error landscape curvature. We find that variations in error landscape structure give rise to tradeoffs in performance; these include the ability of the network to maximize accuracy versus minimize inaccuracy and produce specific versus generalizable representations of information. Parallel networks generate smooth error landscapes with deep, narrow minima, enabling them to find highly specific representations given sufficient time. While accurate, however, these representations are difficult to generalize. In contrast, layered networks generate rough error landscapes with a variety of local minima, allowing them to quickly find coarse representations. Although less accurate, these representations are easily adaptable. The presence of measurable performance tradeoffs in both layered and parallel networks has implications for understanding the behavior of a wide variety of natural and artificial learning systems.},

An agent-based approach was used to reconstruct commercial activity chains and simulate them, along with private vehicles, for a large-scale scenario in Gauteng, South Africa. The simulated activities were compared with the actual observed activities of 5,196 vehicles that were inferred from Global Positioning System logs covering approximately 6 months. The results show that the reconstructed activity chains are both spatially and temporally accurate, especially in areas of high activity density. Freight vehicles are a major contributor to traffic congestion and emissions, and the new approach bridges the gap between the person and the state of the art in commercial transport modeling.},

It replaces the p original variables by a smaller number, q, of derived variables, the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables. Often, it is possible to retain most of the variability in the original variables with q very much smaller than p. Despite its apparent simplicity, principal component analysis has a number of subtleties, and it has many uses and extensions. A number of choices associated with the technique are briefly discussed, namely, covariance or correlation, how many components, and different normalization constraints, as well as confusion with factor analysis. Various uses and extensions are outlined.},

Being able to find the intrinsic low-dimensionality in ensembles of graphs can be useful in a variety of modeling contexts, especially when coarse-graining the detailed graph information is of interest. One of the main challenges in mining graph data is the definition of a suitable pairwise similarity metric in the space of graphs. We explore two practical solutions to solving this problem: one based on finding subgraph densities, and one using spectral information. The approach is illustrated on three test data sets (ensembles of graphs); two of these are obtained from standard graph generating algorithms, while the graphs in the third example are sampled as dynamic snapshots from an evolving network simulation.},

At each time step we change one endpoint of a uniformly chosen edge: the new endpoint is chosen by linear preferential attachment. We consider a sequence of edge reconnecting models where the sequence of initial multigraphs is convergent in a sense which is a natural generalization of the notion of convergence of dense graph sequences, defined by Lovász and Szegedy (J. Combin. Theory Ser B 96 (2006) 933–957). We investigate how the limit object evolves under the edge reconnecting dynamics if we rescale time properly: we give the complete characterization of the time evolution of the limit object from its initial state up to the stationary state, which is described in the companion paper (Ráth and Szakács, in press). In our proofs we use the theory of exchangeable arrays, queuing and diffusion processes. The number of parallel edges and the degrees evolve on different timescales and because of this the model exhibits subaging. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct. Alg., 2012},

	abstract = {We present a computer-assisted approach to coarse graining the evolutionary dynamics of a system of nonidentical oscillators coupled through a (fixed) network structure. The existence of a spectral gap for the coupling network graph Laplacian suggests that the graph dynamics may quickly become low dimensional. Our first choice of coarse variables consists of the components of the oscillator states—their (complex) phase angles—along the leading eigenvectors of this Laplacian. We then use the equation-free framework, circumventing the derivation of explicit coarse-grained equations, to perform computational tasks such as coarse projective integration, coarse fixed-point, and coarse limit-cycle computations. In a second step, we explore an approach to incorporating oscillator heterogeneity in the coarse-graining process. The approach is based on the observation of fast-developing correlations between oscillator state and oscillator intrinsic properties and establishes a connection with tools developed in the context of uncertainty quantification.},

	abstract = {The edit distance is a basic string similarity measure for many applications such as string searching, text mining, signal processing, bioinformatics and so on. However, its high computational cost often prevents it from being used for a large set of strings like similar string searching. A promising solution for the problem is to approximate the edit distance with low computational cost. However, although there are many methods for approximating the edit distance, most of them are analyzed only theoretically. In fact, most of the methods can evaluate the edit distance only in terms of order notations, and do not conduct any experiment. This is a large obstacle for applying them to real applications. In this study we will first list up existing edit distance approximation methods. Then we compare them by: (i) approximation performances shown by the original authors, (ii) approximation performances re-analyzed by us (concrete values instead of the order notations) and (iii) experimental performances by our implementations.},
